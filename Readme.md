## TabReduce

I wanted to build a simple CLI tab manager.
At the moment the support is only there for:
- Chrome web browser

The idea is very very simple. Have a way to reduce the number of tabs.
Increasing your likelihood of focusing and not getting distracted.
Which I have myself had issues with since as long as I had internet.

 
The concept is simple at the moment.
